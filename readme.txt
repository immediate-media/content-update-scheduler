Schedule content updates for any WordPress page or post type.

== Description ==

WordPress lacks a feature to schedule content updates. Keeping your posts and pages up to date manually can often waste your precious time, especially when you already know you'll soon have to update the same page again.

== Use Cases ==
* **Promotions:** Automatically publish versions of your pages that contain temporary promotions and schedule content updates where these promotions are removed as soon as they ended.
* **Events:** Schedule content updates for pages that list events. Automatically publish an updated version of the page after an event ended.
* **SEO:** Schedule series of content updates to keep your pages and publication dates up to date and satisfy the freshness algorithm.

== Key Features ==
* Updates page content and publication date
* Compatible with any post type
* Compatible with Elementor and Oxygen Builder
* Nested content updates (several updates of the same page scheduled in a row)
* Lightweight code

== Credits ==
Developed by [Infinitnet](https://infinitnet.io/) and based on the abandoned plugin [tao-schedule-update](https://github.com/tao-software/tao-schedule-update).
